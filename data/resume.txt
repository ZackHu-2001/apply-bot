• Optimized Entity Framework Core queries using eager loading and query splitting, reducing database round trips
by 65% and improving response times from 800ms to 280ms
• Optimized PWA offline experience using Serwist by implementing precaching strategies for pages and data, local
cache fallbacks for offline requests, and background sync to execute queued requests once connectivity is restored.
• Implemented concurrent editing functionality using SignalR in .NET application, enabling real-time
collaboration with editor presence indicators, and operational transformation for conflict resolution.
• Implemented SAML SSO integration with Okta for enterprise authentication.
